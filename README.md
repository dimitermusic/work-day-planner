# Work Day Scheduler

## Steps

* TODO: Use moment.js and jquery to pull todays date and add it to the html container with the .container class.
* TODO: Create a time block as input/form element with placeholders and button for each hour of the work day from 9am to 5pm using 24hr time and moment.format to make sort in ascending way then append using jquery.
* TODO: Add conditional statement to compare the current time to the calendar blocks and add css classes to style to depict the past, present, and future in relation to right now. CHECK
* TODO: Store user input into variable
* TODO: Add event listener to listen for a click of a button using the "this" method or event.target to grab the specific block associated with the button that is clicked to store input into a variable, add user input as content, then use "setitems" method to store to local storage. Then update placeholder with new user input using get items and jquery.
* TODO: Add "getitems" function to retrieve items saved to local storage and put them on page on page load in the input field as placeholder.

## Issues to be resolved:

* Fix CSS disconnect issue
* For loop is broken
* User input not saving to local storage or showing up on refresh
* Fix JQUERY event listener issue
